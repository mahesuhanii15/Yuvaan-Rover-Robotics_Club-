Yuvaan -An autonomous rover
Yuvaan is an autonomous extraterrestrial rover. i worked majorly on electronics, sensors, and custom circuitry for reliable autonomous operation. The system includes encoder-driven PID control loops for stable wheel actuation and precise odometry. A ROS-based inverse kinematics and behavior framework enables accurate motion execution, supporting SLAM, navigation stacks, and autonomous path planning in dynamic environments.
